# Index Terms of Service

Effective Date: Tuesday, June 17th, 2023

By using Index ("the bot"), you (“the user”) agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (“Terms of Service”). Failure to comply with these terms may result in actions being taken against your account, up to and including permanent banning from using our services.

## Acceptable Use
You agree:

- Not to use multiple or alternate accounts to execute any commands.
- Not to use any form of automation, macros, or self-spam/bot code.
- Not to reverse a payment without first contacting a staff member in our support server for a safe refund.

## Enforcement and Termination

We reserve the right to take enforcement action against any account that we, in our sole discretion, determine to be in violation of these Terms of Service. Such actions may include, but are not limited to:

    Warning the account holder.
    Temporarily suspending the account.
    Permanently banning the account from accessing our services.

The determination of the appropriate enforcement action is at the sole discretion of Index. We reserve the right to make these determinations on a case-by-case basis and to modify our enforcement policies at any time.

## Character Collection and Trading

### Ownership and Licensing

Users have the ability to collect and trade characters within Index. However, the availability of characters is subject to licensing agreements and other legal considerations. Index does not guarantee the continued availability of any specific character. If Index loses the rights to a character, that character may be removed from the platform and users' inventories without notice or compensation.
Trading Restrictions

Users are strictly prohibited from trading characters for real money (USD or any other currency) or any other consideration outside of the Index platform. Such trading is considered unauthorized and is a violation of these Terms of Service.

### Inventory Resets and Reversals

Index reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reset inventories or reverse transactions in the following cases:

- To address economic imbalances within the platform.
- In response to bugs, exploits, or other technical issues that impact the integrity or fairness of the Index platform.

Users acknowledge and agree that such resets or reversals may be made without prior notice, and that Index will not be liable for any loss or damage, whether direct or indirect, resulting from such actions.

## No Monetary Sales of Characters

Index does not, and will never, sell characters for real-world currency, including USD or any other currency. Characters within Index can be collected and traded solely within the platform. Any claims or offerings of characters for sale for real-world currency are unauthorized and not associated with Index. Users are advised to avoid participating in such unauthorized transactions, as they may be scams and are in violation of these Terms of Service.
